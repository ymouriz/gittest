         <p>
            Let's get wild today. Here's something that's fun. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
            We must be quiet, soft and gentle. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.
            All you have to learn here is how to have fun. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.
            This is gonna be a happy little seascape. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white,
            Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.
            There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush.
